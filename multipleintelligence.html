<p>Multiple intelligences is a theory first proposed by psychologist Howard Gardner, and it
	categorises different kinds of intelligences that humans are capable of. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Visual-spatial</li>
<li>Musical</li>
<li>Verbal-linguistic</li>
<li>Logical-mathematical</li>
<li>Bodily-kinestheticl</li>
<li>Interpersonal</li>
<li>Intrapersonal</li>
<li>Naturalistic</li>
<li>Existential</li>

</ul>

<p>The last two were not in Gardner’s original theory but added later. The theory also proposed
	that education needs to work on developing these multiple intelligences in children. There are several ways that have been proposed and practiced to nurture this intelligence in schoolchildren. The introduction of visual aids, music lessons, sports, yoga, and meditation, social service initiatives, and other aspects of schools, work towards this and is a significant move forward from classical classrooms that focused on developing only one or two of these
	intelligence. The theory first came out in 1983 and received considerable attention at the time. Why then, are we still in classrooms that are not spaces where these can be developed? And,
	even if they are, the different types of intelligence are often hierarchized, and we seem to follow this hierarchization rather religiously. For example, our education system today lays a great deal of emphasis, unconsciously, on logical-mathematical and verbal-linguistic intelligence. In India, children’s education is inevitably geared towards one of three streams: Commerce, Science, or Social Sciences. Only a tiny minority goes into “radically different” streams (like Performing Arts or Physical Education). Since these dominant streams
	inevitably focus on one or both of the intelligence mentioned above, this reinforces the hierarchy and renders the others so unimportant as to almost never be nurtured at all. In short, education today is fostering incomplete, cognitively malnourished individuals.</p>


<p>One way that teachers in the classroom can do this is formulated their teaching
	modules keeping in mind all the intelligence. For example, a math class
	(mathematical-logical) can be told to discuss, in groups, the various ways that a solution can be reached (interpersonal). A science class can happen in the garden, to demonstrate, practically, the theories that they’re learning (naturalistic and bodily-kinesthetic). Musical and Bodily-Kinesthetic intelligence can be nurtured – and the “proper” lesson itself deeply enriched – in language classes, where students can be asked to put up plays, or even pay attention to the cadences and rhythms that are an intrinsic part of the language (and especially poetry).</p>
	<p>
		Besides this, of course, it is important as teachers to ensure that the classes that
exclusively develop the less popular intelligence- art, music, drama, yoga, sports and so on.
Quite often these classes are neglected and taught superficially since there is no strict curriculum or exam pattern. We should take this opportunity to be creative with our teaching methods in these classes and actively make sure that all the students are engaged and try their hand at these subjects. This is, of course, far easier said than done. Considering the strength of classrooms in our schools, it becomes quite a challenge to track each student’s cognitive development. One way is to give them group assignments, and discussions, where they will need to present their work. As with much of education in India, tracking and using multiple intelligences can sometimes seem futile and not worth the effort; our curricula aren’t built for it, our infrastructure doesn’t always accommodate it. Nonetheless, change starts small, and teachers brave enough to be creative in the classroom are going to be at the forefront of that big difference.
